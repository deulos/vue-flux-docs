## 6.0.0
Description

Bugs fixed:
* aaa

New features:  
* The attributes passed to vue-flux component options, images and transitions are now reactive.
* The computed properties currentImage and nextImage are now methods.
* Added infinite option to tell the slider to start over when reaches last image.
* Transitions round2 and explode have by default odd number of columns so they look more "zen".
